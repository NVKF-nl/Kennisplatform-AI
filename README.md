#Welcome!

Repository to collect and organize a list of courses, references/material maintained by the Kennisplatform AI of the NVKF (Dutch Society of Medical Physicists).
This page is available at: [https://nvkf-nl.github.io/Kennisplatform-AI/](https://nvkf-nl.github.io/Kennisplatform-AI/) and editable by the member of the Kenniplatform via [https://github.com/NVKF-nl/Kennisplatform-AI/](https://github.com/NVKF-nl/Kennisplatform-AI/).

## Make the table sortable

If you wish to extend the interaction with the tables, you can sort the columns in your favorite browser, as described [here](https://github.com/Mottie/GitHub-userscripts/wiki/GitHub-sort-content). We have tested on Chrome the following combination:
* install [Tampermonkey](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tampermonkey/dhdgffkkebhmkfjojejmpbldmpobfkfo/related);
* install [Github Sort Content](https://greasyfork.org/en/scripts/21373-github-sort-content);
